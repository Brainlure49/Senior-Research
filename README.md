# Senior-Research
Senior Research Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains three R scripts for kNN, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifiers. These accept csv (or text) files in the format of: "key", "A", "A#", "B", "C", "C#", "D", "D#", "E", "F", "F#", "G", "G#"

This repository also contains a visual basic project which reads in a MIDI file, takes user input about that file, and writes the proportion of notes in that file to a text document. Included is a MIDI file for Thunderstruck by AC/DC as a demonstration.
